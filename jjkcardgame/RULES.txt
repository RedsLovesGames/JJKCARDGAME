Card Types
1. Areas (Max 1 per side)

   * Provide buffs or debuffs to all creatures on that player's field.
   * Could have continuous effects (like boosting certain types of cards) or one-time effects (triggering upon placement).
   * Example:
   * Shibuya Incident – Sorcerers lose 10% HP per turn but gain +50 ATK when fighting in the Area.
   2. Creatures (Sorcerers & Cursed Spirits)

      * These are the main battle units with ATK (Attack), DEF (Defense), and HP.
      * The characters all have main and ultimate abilities
      * Ultimate abilities cost credits


      3. Spells (Abilities, Traps, and Special Moves)

         * Can be instant, continuous, or triggered.
         * Some may require conditions (e.g., only usable when HP is below 500).
         * Example:
         * Extraction Technique: Choose a card. Gain Energy equal to the cost of its Ultimate Attack.
