# Card Battle System Rules

## Basic Game Setup
- Each player starts with 2000 Life Points
- Each player starts with a 40-card deck
- Initial hand size is 5 cards
- Players draw 1 card at the start of their turn

## Energy System
- Players start with 1 energy
- Energy increases by 1 each turn
- Maximum energy cap is 10
- Energy is used to play cards based on their cost

## Battle Flow
1. Draw Phase
   - Active player draws 1 card
   - Energy regenerates for both players

2. Main Phase
   - Player can play cards if they have sufficient energy
   - Cards can be played to the field
   - Cost of the card is deducted from available energy

3. Battle Phase
   - Cards on the field can attack opponent's cards or directly attack Life Points
   - Damage calculation: Attacking card's ATK vs Defending card's DEF
   - If a card's DEF reaches 0, it is destroyed
   - Direct attacks subtract ATK from opponent's Life Points

## Card Mechanics
- Cards automatically heal to full DEF at the start of each turn unless destroyed
- Destroyed cards are removed from the field
- Each card gains 1 energy point per turn
- Ultimate moves require 2 energy points to activate

## Victory Conditions
- Reduce opponent's Life Points to 0
- If opponent cannot draw a card when required
- If battle exceeds 20 turns, the game ends in a draw

## Important Notes
- Only monster cards are used (no spell or battlefield cards)
- Each card's DEF acts as its HP
- Cards must be on the field for one turn before attacking
- Players can have up to 5 cards on the field at once
